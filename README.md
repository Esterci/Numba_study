# Numba Studies Repository

Welcome to the **Numba Studies Repository**! This repository is dedicated to learning, experimenting, and applying the Numba library in Python to accelerate numerical computations. 

## What is Numba?

[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is an open-source JIT (just-in-time) compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code using the LLVM compiler. It is particularly useful for CPU and GPU accelerated computing in Python without the need to switch to lower-level languages like C or C++.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the examples and experiments in this repository, you will need:

- Python 3.7+
- `Numba` library
- `NumPy` library
- (Optional) `CUDA` toolkit for GPU acceleration examples

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numba numpy
```

For GPU support, ensure you have a compatible CUDA setup and install:

```bash
conda install cudatoolkit numba
```

### How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/numba-studies.git
   cd numba-studies
   ```

2. **Run individual scripts:**

   You can explore different Numba features by running any script inside the corresponding directory. For example:

   ```bash
   python basics/jit_basics.py
   ```

3. **Experiment with optimizations:**

   Modify existing scripts or create new ones to experiment with Numbaâ€™s features, including:
   - Using the `@jit` and `@njit` decorators
   - Parallelizing loops
   - Offloading computations to the GPU

## Key Concepts

- **JIT Compilation (`@jit`, `@njit`)**: Numba provides a decorator to mark Python functions that should be JIT-compiled. It can operate in "nopython" mode, where Python interpreter features are eliminated, providing even greater speed improvements.
  
- **Parallelization**: Numba can parallelize loops and array operations using multithreading or GPU-based parallelism.

- **GPU Acceleration**: Numba integrates with CUDA to enable GPU-accelerated computation on Nvidia GPUs.

## Examples

### Simple Example

Here's a simple Numba example that speeds up a function by compiling it with `@jit`.

```python
import numba
import numpy as np

@numba.jit
def sum_of_squares(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += i ** 2
    return total

print(sum_of_squares(10**6))
```

### GPU Example

This example demonstrates how to offload computations to the GPU using Numba's `cuda` module.

```python
from numba import cuda
import numpy as np

@cuda.jit
def add_arrays(a, b, c):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < a.size:
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i]

n = 100000
a = np.ones(n)
b = np.ones(n)
c = np.zeros(n)

threads_per_block = 512
blocks_per_grid = (a.size + (threads_per_block - 1)) // threads_per_block
add_arrays[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](a, b, c)

print(c[:10])  # Prints first 10 elements of the result
```
